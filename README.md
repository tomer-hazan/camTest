This project allows the user to find disturbances in the projection of Maradinâ€™s products and be a base for future projects with allied vision cameras.
therefore those are the capabilities of the project:
  1. capturing images in different ways(with/without trigger and with variable fps)
  2. saving images as files(jpg/png) or as videos(mp4)
  3. find differences between frames and color them
  4. find the bounding rectangle of the projection (experimental)
